                    <h6>“He gave man speech, and speech created thought, Which is the measure of the Universe”—Prometheus Unbound, Shelley</h6>
                    <p>Human beings ... are very much at the mercy of the particular language which has become the medium of expression for their society. It is quite an illusion to imagine that one adjusts to reality essentially without the use of language and that language is merely an incidental means of solving specific problems of communication and reflection. The fact of the matter is that the “real world” is to a large extent unconsciously built up on the language habits of the group. 
                    The Status of Linguistics as a Science, 1929, Edward Sapir</p>
                    <p>Like any human language, Java provides a way to express concepts. If successful, this medium of expression will be significantly easier and more flexible than the alternatives as problems grow larger and more complex. 
                    You can’t look at Java as just a collection of features—some of the features make no sense in isolation. You can use the sum of the parts only if you are thinking about design, not simply coding. And to understand Java in this way, you must understand the problems with the language and with programming in general. This book discusses programming problems, why they are problems, and the approach Java has taken to solve them. Thus, the set of features that I explain in each chapter are based on the way I see a particular type of problem being solved with the language. In this way I hope to move you, a little at a time, to the point where the Java mindset becomes your native tongue. 
                    Throughout, I’ll be taking the attitude that you want to build a model in your head that allows you to develop a deep understanding of the language; if you encounter a puzzle, you’ll feed it to your model and deduce the answer. </p>
                    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
                    <p>This book assumes that you have some programming familiarity: You understand that a program is a collection of statements, the idea of a subroutine/function/macro, control statements such as “if” and looping constructs such as “while,” etc. However, you might have learned this in many places, such as programming with a macro language or working with a tool like Perl. As long as you’ve programmed to the point where you feel comfortable with the basic ideas of programming, you’ll be able to work through this book. Of course, the book will be easier for C programmers and more so for C++ programmers, but don’t count yourself out if you’re not experienced with those languages—however, come willing to work hard. Also, the Thinking in C multimedia seminar that you can download from www.MindView.net will bring you up to speed in the fundamentals necessary to learn Java. However, I will be introducing the concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) and Java’s basic control mechanisms. 
                    Although references may be made to C and C++ language features, these are not intended to be insider comments, but instead to help all programmers put Java in perspective with those languages, from which, after all, Java is descended. I will attempt to make these references simple and to explain anything that I think a non-C/C++ programmer would not be familiar with.</p>
                    <h5>Learning Java</h5>
                    <p>At about the same time that my first book, Using C++ (Osborne/McGraw-Hill, 1989), came out, I began teaching that language. Teaching programming ideas has become my profession; I’ve seen nodding heads, blank faces, and puzzled expressions in audiences all over the world since 1987. As I began giving in-house training with smaller groups of people, I discovered something during the exercises. Even those people who were smiling and nodding were confused about many issues. I found out, by creating and chairing the C++ track at the Software Development Conference for a number of years (and later creating and chairing the Java track), that I and other speakers tended to give the typical audience too many topics too quickly. So eventually, through both variety in the audience level and the way that I presented the material, I would end up losing some portion of the audience. Maybe it’s asking too much, but because I am one of those people resistant to traditional lecturing (and for most people, I believe, such resistance results from boredom), I wanted to try to keep everyone up to speed. 
                    For a time, I was creating a number of different presentations in fairly short order. Thus, I ended up learning by experiment and iteration (a technique that also works well in program design). Eventually, I developed a course using everything I had learned from my teaching experience. My company, MindView, Inc., now gives this as the public and in-house Thinking in Java seminar; this is our main introductory seminar that provides the foundation for our more advanced seminars. You can find details at www.MindView.net. (The introductory seminar is also available as the Hands-On Java CD ROM. Information is available at the same Web site.) 
                    The feedback that I get from each seminar helps me change and refocus the material until I think it works well as a teaching medium. But this book isn’t just seminar notes; I tried to pack as much information as I could within these pages, and structured it to draw you through into the next subject. More than anything, the book is designed to serve the solitary reader who is struggling with a new programming language.</p>
                    <h3>Goals</h3>
                    <p>Like my previous book, Thinking in C++, this book was designed with one thing in mind: the way people learn a language. When I think of a chapter in the book, I think in terms of what makes a good lesson during a seminar. Seminar audience feedback helped me understand the difficult parts that needed illumination. In the areas where I got ambitious and included too many features all at once, I came to know—through the process of presenting the material—that if you include a lot of new features, you need to explain them all, and this easily compounds the student’s confusion. 
                    Each chapter tries to teach a single feature, or a small group of associated features, without relying on concepts that haven’t been introduced yet. That way you can digest each piece in the context of your current knowledge before moving on. 
                    My goals in this book are to:</p>
                    1.	<p>Present the material one simple step at a time so that you can easily digest each idea before moving on. Carefully sequence the presentation of features so that you’re exposed to a topic before you see it in use. Of course, this isn’t always possible; in those situations, a brief introductory description is given.</p>
                    2.	<p>Use examples that are as simple and short as possible. This sometimes prevents me from tackling “real world” problems, but I’ve found that beginners are usually happier when they can understand every detail of an example rather than being impressed by 
                    
                    
                    the scope of the problem it solves. Also, there’s a severe limit to the amount of code that can be absorbed in a classroom situation. For this I will no doubt receive criticism for using “toy examples,” but I’m willing to accept that in favor of producing something pedagogically useful. </p>
                    
                    3.	<p>Give you what I think is important for you to understand about the language, rather than everything that I know. I believe there is an information importance hierarchy, and that there are some facts that 95 percent of programmers will never need to know—details that just confuse people and increase their perception of the complexity of the language. To take an example from C, if you memorize the operator precedence table (I never did), you can write clever code. But if you need to think about it, it will also confuse the reader/maintainer of that code. So forget about precedence, and use parentheses when things aren’t clear. 
                    
                    	Keep each section focused enough so that the lecture time—and the time between exercise periods—is small. Not only does this keep the audience’s minds more active and involved during a hands-on seminar, but it gives the reader a greater sense of accomplishment. 
                    
                    	Provide you with a solid foundation so that you can understand the issues well enough to move on to more difficult coursework and books. </p>
                    
                    <h3>Teaching from this book</h3>
                    <p>The original edition of this book evolved from a one-week seminar which was, when Java was in its infancy, enough time to cover the language. As Java grew and continued to encompass more and more features and libraries, I stubbornly tried to teach it all in one week. At one point, a customer asked me to teach “just the fundamentals,” and in doing so I discovered that trying to cram everything into a single week had become painful for both myself and for seminarians. Java was no longer a “simple” language that could be taught in a week. 
                    That experience and realization drove much of the reorganization of this book, which is now designed to support a two-week seminar or a two-term college course. The introductory portion ends with the Error Handling with Exceptions chapter, but you may also want to supplement this with an introduction to JDBC, Servlets and JSPs. This provides a foundation course, and is the core of the Hands-On Java CD ROM. The remainder of the book comprises an intermediatelevel course, and is the material covered in the Intermediate Thinking in Java CD ROM. Both of these CD ROMs are for sale at www.MindView.net. 
                    Contact Prentice-Hall at www.prenhallprofessional.com for information about professor support materials for this book.</p>
                    <h3>JDK HTML documentation </h3>
                    <p>The Java language and libraries from Sun Microsystems (a free download from http://java.sun.com) come with documentation in electronic form, readable using a Web browser. Many books published on Java have duplicated this documentation. So you either already have it or you can download it, and unless necessary, this book will not repeat that documentation, because it’s usually much faster if you find the class descriptions with your Web browser than if you look them up in a book (and the online documentation is probably more upto-date). You’ll simply be referred to “the JDK documentation.” This book will provide extra descriptions of the classes only when it’s necessary to supplement that documentation so you can understand a particular example.</p>
                    <h3>Exercises</h3>
                    <p>I’ve discovered that simple exercises are exceptionally useful to complete a student’s understanding during a seminar, so you’ll find a set at the end of each chapter. 
                    Most exercises are designed to be easy enough that they can be finished in a reasonable amount of time in a classroom situation while the instructor observes, making sure that all the students are absorbing the material. Some are more challenging, but none present major challenges. 
                    Solutions to selected exercises can be found in the electronic document The Thinking in Java Annotated Solution Guide, available for sale from www.MindView.net. </p>
                    <h3>Foundations for Java</h3>
                    <p>Another bonus with this edition is the free multimedia seminar that you can download from www.MindView.net. This is the Thinking in C seminar that gives you an introduction to the C syntax, operators, and functions that Java syntax is based upon. In previous editions of the book this was in the Foundations for Java CD that was packaged with the book, but now the seminar may be freely downloaded. 
                    I originally commissioned Chuck Allison to create Thinking in C as a standalone product, but decided to include it with the 2nd edition of Thinking in C++ and 2nd and 3rd editions of Thinking in Java because of the consistent experience of having people come to seminars without an adequate background in basic C syntax. The thinking apparently goes “I’m a smart programmer and I don’t want to learn C, but rather C++ or Java, so I’ll just skip C and go directly to C++/Java.” After arriving at the seminar, it slowly dawns on folks that the prerequisite of understanding C syntax is there for a very good reason. 
                    Technologies have changed, and it made more sense to rework Thinking in C as a downloadable Flash presentation rather than including it as a CD. By providing this seminar online, I can ensure that everyone can begin with adequate preparation. 
                    The Thinking in C seminar also allows the book to appeal to a wider audience. Even though the Operators and Controlling Execution chapters do cover the fundamental parts of Java that come from C, the online seminar is a gentler introduction, and assumes even less about the student’s programming background than does the book. </p>

                    <h5>Coding standards</h5>
                    <p>In the text of this book, identifiers (methods, variables, and class names) are set in bold. Most keywords are also set in bold, except for those keywords that are used so much that the bolding can become tedious, such as “class.” 
                    I use a particular coding style for the examples in this book. As much as possible, this follows the style that Sun itself uses in virtually all of the code you will find at its site (see http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/index.html), and seems to be supported by most Java development environments. If you’ve read my other works, you’ll also notice that Sun’s coding style coincides with mine—this pleases me, although I had nothing (that I know of) to do with it. The subject of formatting style is good for hours of hot debate, so I’ll just say I’m not trying to dictate correct style via my examples; I have my own motivation for using the style that I do. Because Java is a free-form programming language, you can continue to use whatever style you’re comfortable with. One solution to the coding style issue is to use a tool like Jalopy (www.triemax.com), which assisted me in developing this book, to change formatting to that which suits you. 
                    The code files printed in the book are tested with an automated system, and should all work without compiler errors. 
                    This book focuses on and is tested with Java SE5/6. If you need to learn about earlier releases of the language that are not covered in this edition, the 1st through 3rd editions of the book are freely downloadable at www.MindView.net. </p>
                    <h3>Errors</h3>
                    <p>No matter how many tools a writer uses to detect errors, some always creep in and these often leap off the page for a fresh reader. If you discover anything you believe to be an error, please use the link you will find for this book at www.MindView.net to submit the error along with your suggested correction. Your help is appreciated. </p>
